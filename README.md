iOS MapKit Overlay Coordinate plist
===================================

The overlays.plist file contains the latitude and longitude coordinates that allow you to
create custom region overlays for the iOS MapKit Framework. 
Take a look at the screenshot to see and example of what you can do with this plist and MapKit.

Supported Regions
-----------------
Currently only 50 US states are included in the file. Feel free to add more regions, countries,
and states if you have the data. 

The USA states are accessible in the dictionary with the key **US_[*State Short Code (ie: NY, NJ, PA, etc...*]**
